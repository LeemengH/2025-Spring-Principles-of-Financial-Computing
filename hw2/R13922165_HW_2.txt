Parameter Definition:
    1. T denote the time to expiration of the option measured in years.
    2. N denote the total time steps.
    3. dt means each period is delta t years long.
    4. To make nodes at the same horizontal level of the tree hvae identical price). By page 299, Let u = e^(sigma*((delta t)^(1/2))).
    5. The pseudo probability p = (R - d) / (u - d) (Note: The period gross return R is e^(r*dt)).
    6. The discount is e^(-r * dt).

Step 1: Initialization
  - Initialze the asset price, C and P in the tree.

Step 2: Backward Induction
  - check the early excise condition based on early exercise dates.
